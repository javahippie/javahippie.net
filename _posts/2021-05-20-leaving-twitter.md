## So long and thanks for all the fish
Earlier this year I took ~6 weeks off of Twitter as a mental health break. Two months after I started being active again, I now decided that it's best to leave the platform entirely. I will miss the interaction with some brilliant and kind people, but I have realized that being on Twitter caused way more negative feelings for me which outweighted the nice moments by far. Instead I will try to be more active in forums, discords and smaller communities again in the future.

I won't delete my account, so past threads and discussions are still intact.
