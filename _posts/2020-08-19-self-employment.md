This week, after 6.5 years, I handed in my resignation at ilum:e informatik ag. I decided, that the time has come to follow a wish I held for some time now - to become my own boss. 

I am looking back at many years with great colleagues, many of whom have become good friends. I am looking back at many great experiences that taught me about software development, architecture, customer interaction and leadership. And it is with a heavy heart that I will leave "my" team with all those different, strong and interesting characters who have taught me a lot of things, too. 

I will start as a Freelancer from January on, preferrably working remote, and I am looking forward to many interesting projects and trainings to come. I will keep my focus worth a decade on Java and the JVM, but I do hope that I might be able to earn my first money working with Clojure, too. On the one hand, this will give me the time and freedom to speak at some more conferences and usergroups, write some more articles and be a little more active in the Open Source community. On the other hand, it will give me room to work on a product idea which me and a friend had for some time now. 

I wish my colleagues the very best and am looking forward to an interesting year 2021.
