title: Work with me!

Starting January 2021, I am open for freelance offers, preferrably working remotely. I can offer 12 years of skills in Java, JavaScript, SQL and web technologies, architecture and Clojure. I also provide trainings on Git, Java, Workflow Engines (Camunda) and Eclipse MicroProfile.

If you are running a Usergroup, Tech Community or Community Conference, I will gladly speak at one of you events without any charge.

If you would like to work with me, please contact me with one of the social buttons at the bottom of this site.
